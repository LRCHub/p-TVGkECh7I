I don't know how it got this bad, I just want to kick it
I don't know why I hurt this bad, I just want to quit it
Days go by faster, and everything hits at the same time
Mask it with laugher, smoke something and pretend that I'm fine
I'm fine, I'm fine
And I fall into the rabbit hole again
And no one likes to drink alone, so come be my friend
Say that you love me and that you can still see my vision
Cuz All I see is double, as I hold my guts down in the kitchen
You push onto me as I push one more drink up to my lips
You're tripping off the weed and I'm dripping for your face in my hips
My hips, my hips
And I fall into the rabbit hole again
And no one likes to drink alone, so come be my friend
And I fall into the rabbit hole again
And no one likes to drink alone, so come be my friend
Be my friend
Come be my friend
I need a friend
Help me pretend
