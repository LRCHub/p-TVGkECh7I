Every change comes with reason
Still we will blame the time
If we don't face tomorrow
Today becomes hard to follow
Until the minutes collapse into this photograph
Too many memories left just to be rescued
I need this explanation to remind me I'm falling
*
Will you come find me sinking
to the bottom alone
I've lost all control to do this alone
**
I can not find escape at the bottom alone
Please don't let me go
Don't let me go
***
I'm falling
I'm drowning
Way deeper down the rabbit hole
I'm falling
I'm drowning
Deeper deeper down the endless rabbit hole
Sudden change comes with meaning
Inside those brand new eyes
If we can face tomorrow
We will let go of these sorrow
We'll let the minutes surpass
inside this photograph
Cause we're the memories kept safe to be rescued
Its not the explanation
that reminds me I'm calling
So when you find me,
sinking to the bottom alone,
I've lost all control to do this alone
**Repeat
*＆**Repeat
***Repeat
