I
Feel like gettin' high
Meet me on the corner
Know I won't be long, yeah
On the other side
Tonight
Gonna get out of my mind
Make me something strong, yeah
Act like nothing's wrong, yeah
Just to get me by
And castle magic
It's all in my head
Come find me
down the rabbit hole
I think I've done it all
How can I convince myself
That it's all in my head?
Can you change
The colours on her face?
Everybody feels nice
Bathin' in the sunshine
And burnin' in the rays
And castle magic
It's all in my head
Come find me
down the rabbit hole
I think I've done it all
How can I convince myself
That it's all in my head?
I'm not trying to escape
I am happy to stay
How long will it take?
Before the rain comes in
Come find me
down the rabbit hole
I think I've done it all
How can I convince myself
That it's all in my head?
Come find me
down the rabbit hole
I think I've done it all
How can I convince myself
That it's all in my head?
