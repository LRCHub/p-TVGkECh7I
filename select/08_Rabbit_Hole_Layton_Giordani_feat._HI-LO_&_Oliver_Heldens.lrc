[00:37.96] Let me tell why you're here
[00:41.40] You're here because you know something
[00:44.37] What you know, you can't explain
[00:48.18] But you feel it
[00:55.68] 
[00:50.01] You felt it your entire life
[00:53.87] I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice
[01:00.70] Tom blink down for rabbit hole
[01:03.65] You can see in it
[01:12.15] 
[02:08.04] It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes
[02:12.15] To blind you from the truth
