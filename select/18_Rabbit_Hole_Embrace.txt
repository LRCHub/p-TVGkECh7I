When you're down the rabbit hole
And no one wants to know
Let me in
I will be your strength
Everyone hits the ropes
I'll be your only hope
And I won't give in

When you've made your own luck
But you didn't make enough
Let me explain
Some things never change
I didn't make the rules
But breaking them's all I do
If you can promise me

If you're looking for something
If your search is without end
If you're looking for one thing
Ah, don't be afraid
If it won't go your way

When your back's against the wall
And there's nowhere left to fall
Let them take aim
I will light the way
I'll never let you fail
I'll fight 'em tooth and nail
If you can swear one thing

When you're looking for something
And you're searching without end
When you're looking for one thing
Ah, don't be afraid
If it won't go your way

'Cause we're all looking for something
And it's a search that's without end
If you're looking for something
Ah, don't be afraid
When it won't go your way
