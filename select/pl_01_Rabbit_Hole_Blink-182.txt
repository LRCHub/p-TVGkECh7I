DEAR HEAD SHUT UP
I CAN'T LISTEN NO MORE
IT'S LATE SO SHUT UP
IS ONE NIGHT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR
YOU ARE A HAUNTED HOUSE
YOU'RE SUPERSTITIOUS
YOU ARE THE COLDEST STONE-CARVED MARBLE FACES
I WON'T FALL DOWN THAT FUCKING RABBIT HOLE
I'M BARELY STANDING ON THE GROUND
ALL THE HINTS THAT YOU LEAVE
ARE TOO HARD TO BELIEVE AT ALL
I WONT FALL DOWN THAT FUCKING RABBIT HOLE
WITH YOU AGAIN
THIS BED ON FIRE
I CAN'T SLEEP HERE NO MORE
TOO LATE AND TIRED
DREAMING DOWN ON THE FLOOR
I AM A HAUNTED HOUSE
I'M SUPERSTITIOUS
I AM A CARDBOARD CUTOUT OLD AND FADED
